# Countries

A Country represents a real country that your shop is willing to sell its goods in (for example the UK). It has an ISO code to be identified easily (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2).

Countries might also have Provinces, which is in fact a general name for an administrative division, within a country. Therefore we understand provinces as states of the USA, voivodeships of Poland, cantons of Belgium or Bundesl√§nder of Germany.
